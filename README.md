# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Environment

You need the following environment variables set to make this app work:

```
REACT_APP_OS_API_KEY
REACT_APP_MAPBOX_TOKEN
REACT_APP_WATER_NETWORK_API_KEY
```

- The OS API key is for the [OS Names API](https://osdatahub.os.uk/docs/names/gettingStarted)
- The Mapbox token is for [Mapbox GL JS](https://account.mapbox.com)
- The Water Network API key is the base64-encoded basic auth token for the [Water Network API](https://defra-water-network-prod.publishmydata.com/water-network/)

## Development

In the project directory, run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

## Deployment

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
